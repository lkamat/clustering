Newsner,"It all began in March 2016, when a homeless man named Marcus walked into Abi's Cafe in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
He looked the cafe's owner, Cesia Abigail, right in the eye and asked for money.
""Why don't you have a job,"" she answered, adding, ""You know nothing is given to me for free right?""
The homeless man told Cesia that a job was what he wanted most in the world.
But due to his criminal record, scoring a job had proved impossible for him and he'd been forced to retreat to a life in the streets.
Marcus's story hit Cesia right in the chest — and she immediately decided to put her money where her mouth is.",2017-09-09T14:12:00Z,reddit-r-all,"She gives homeless man a job – 2 weeks later, he's hired for good",http://en.newsner.com/she-gives-homeless-man-a-job-2-weeks-later-he-s-hired-for-good/about/family,http://cdn4.newsner.com/attachments/images/000/294/862/facebook_image/cafe_owner.jpg,general,2017-09-11 10:55:03.043011
