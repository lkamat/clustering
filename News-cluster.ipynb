The storm engulfed nearly the entire Florida peninsula, wreaking havoc from the state's southernmost point up to the Georgia line, from the Atlantic coast to the Gulf side.

(AP) — Leading his first commemoration of the solemn 9/11 anniversary, President Donald Trump said Monday that \"the living, breathing soul of America wept with grief\" for each of the nearly 3,000 lives that were lost on that day 16 years ago. Addressing an audience at the Pentagon, one of three sites attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, Trump used the anniversary to warn terrorists that \"America cannot be intimidated.\" He said those who try are destined to join \"the long list of vanquished enemies who dared to test our mettle.\"\n",

(AP) \\u2014 Hurricane Irma weakened into a still-dangerous tropical storm Monday as it pushed inland, triggering record flooding in Florida's northeastern corner, while rescuers in its soggy, wind-battered wake mobilized to reach victims and learn the full extent of the damage. The storm engulfed nearly the entire Florida peninsula, wreaking havoc from the state's southernmost point up to the Georgia line, from the Atlantic coast to the Gulf side. It swamped homes, uprooted massive trees, flooded streets, cast boats ashore, snapped miles of power lines and toppled construction cranes.\",\"NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 Holding photos and reading names of loved ones lost 16 years ago, 9/11 victims' relatives marked the anniversary of the attacks at ground zero on Monday with a solemn and personal ceremony.

Addressing an audience at the Pentagon, one of three sites attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, Trump used the anniversary to warn terrorists that \\\"America cannot be intimidated.\\\" He said those who try are destined to join \\\"the long list of vanquished enemies who dared to test our mettle.\\\"\",\"WASHINGTON (AP) \\u2014 The Trump administration is back at the Supreme Court, asking the justices to continue to allow strict enforcement of a temporary ban on refugees from around the world.

The storm engulfed nearly the entire Florida peninsula, wreaking havoc from the state's southernmost point up to the Georgia line, from the Atlantic coast to the Gulf side.

(AP) \\u2014 Hurricane Irma weakened into a still-dangerous tropical storm Monday as it pushed inland, triggering record flooding in Florida's northeastern corner, while rescuers in its soggy, wind-battered wake mobilized to reach victims and learn the full extent of the damage. The storm engulfed nearly the entire Florida peninsula, wreaking havoc from the state's southernmost point up to the Georgia line, from the Atlantic coast to the Gulf side. It swamped homes, uprooted massive trees, flooded streets, cast boats ashore, snapped miles of power lines and toppled construction cranes.\",\"NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 Holding photos and reading names of loved ones lost 16 years ago, 9/11 victims' relatives marked the anniversary of the attacks at ground zero on Monday with a solemn and personal ceremony.

Addressing an audience at the Pentagon, one of three sites attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, Trump used the anniversary to warn terrorists that \\\"America cannot be intimidated.\\\" He said those who try are destined to join \\\"the long list of vanquished enemies who dared to test our mettle.\\\"\",\"WASHINGTON (AP) \\u2014 The Trump administration is back at the Supreme Court, asking the justices to continue to allow strict enforcement of a temporary ban on refugees from around the world. The Justice Department's high court filing Monday follows an appeals court ruling last week that would allow refugees to enter the United States if a resettlement agency in the U.S. had agreed to take them in. The appellate ruling could take effect as soon as Tuesday and could apply to up to 24,000 refugees.\",\"PARIS (AP) \\u2014 Some black and mixed-race residents of the hurricane-devastated French territory on the island of St. Martin are expressing anger at a perception that white tourists have been given priority during evacuations.

The gunmen later opened fire with machine guns and commandeered a police pickup truck.\",\"UNITED NATIONS (AP) \\u2014 The U.N. Security Council was scheduled to vote late Monday on a new, watered-down sanctions resolution against North Korea that eliminates initial U.S. demands to ban all oil imports to the country and freeze international assets of the government and its leader Kim Jong Un. The draft resolution, agreed to late Sunday after final negotiations between the U.S. and China, the North's ally and main trading partner, also eliminates a U.S. proposal to authorize the use of force to board nine named ships, which it said violated previous U.N. sanctions resolutions, to carry out inspections.\",\"The long-running saga over McLaren's partnership with Honda appears to be coming to an end - and the solution could be a win for all concerned, writes Andrew Benson.\",\"JJ Watt, the superstar defensive end for the Houston Texans, receives a hero's ovation in his first home game of the NFL season after raising $30m to aid Hurricane Harvey victims.\",\"BBC Sport looks back at some of the shortest managerial reigns in football, following Frank de Boer's departure as Crystal Palace manager after 77 days.\",\"U.S. stocks rose toward a record, the dollar strengthened and Treasuries tumbled as investors piled into riskier assets after Hurricane Irma wreaked\\u00a0less damage than forecast and North Korea failed to exacerbate tensions.\",\"The Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to restore its temporary ban on thousands of refugees seeking entry to the country.\",\"Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Officer Matthias Mueller announced sweeping plans to build electric versions of all 300 models in the group\\u2019s lineup as the world\\u2019s largest automaker accelerates the shift away from combustion engines and tries to draw a line under the emissions-cheating scandal.\",\"Amazon.com Inc.\\u2019s splashy takeover of Whole Foods, complete with deep price cuts, brought a surge of publicity to the chain.

The storm engulfed nearly the entire Florida peninsula, wreaking havoc from the state's southernmost point up to the Georgia line, from the Atlantic coast to the Gulf side. It swamped homes, uprooted massive trees, flooded streets, cast boats ashore, snapped miles of power lines and toppled construction cranes.\",\"NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 Holding photos and reading names of loved ones lost 16 years ago, 9/11 victims' relatives marked the anniversary of the attacks at ground zero on Monday with a solemn and personal ceremony.

Addressing an audience at the Pentagon, one of three sites attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, Trump used the anniversary to warn terrorists that \\\"America cannot be intimidated.\\\" He said those who try are destined to join \\\"the long list of vanquished enemies who dared to test our mettle.\\\"\",\"WASHINGTON (AP) \\u2014 The Trump administration is back at the Supreme Court, asking the justices to continue to allow strict enforcement of a temporary ban on refugees from around the world.
